This project is first game created in Phaser, animations in HTML. 

The file manifest consists of index.HTML, assets(the pngs used), and a phaser.js file inside a public file. It also consists
of a .gitignore file and a phases.js file with modules and etc.

I used a step by step tutorial on how to create the game via phasers own site, https://phaser.io/

Then changed the stars icon, to a football icon
